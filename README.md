## About

* Senior Software Engineer specializing in architecting and scaling high-load distributed systems for advertising, search, and logistics platforms.
* With over 5 years of experience, I have a proven track record of end-to-end ownershipâ€”from designing system architecture to driving performance optimization and leading technical initiatives.

# Key Achievements:

* Architected a multi-vertical ad platform at Magnit from the ground up, designing 10+ microservices that handle 1000+ RPS and process 1+ TB of data daily for fraud detection.

* Led significant performance enhancements at Vi.Tech, slashing search indexation time by 66% and reducing API latency by 33% under load, directly improving user experience for millions of customers.

* Engineered robust backend systems across diverse domains including financial transactions (VK), B2B logistics (Xplanet), and secure data aggregation for fintech and banking clients.

* I am passionate about solving complex technical challenges and thrive in environments where I can take ownership, mentor teammates, and contribute to a product's strategic direction. I am seeking a senior role where I can apply my expertise in Golang, Kafka, and PostgreSQL to build world-class, scalable infrastructure.
